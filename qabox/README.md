# QABox — "Through the Looking Glass"

## 🧠 Background

You've made your way into RepoServer, and with root access, you've found something interesting — a trusted path to the internal QA environment: QABox.

QABox is used for validating builds and testing automation scripts. Access is tightly controlled — except when shortcuts are taken. Thanks to reused keys and developer laziness, you've found a crack in the perimeter.

## 🎯 Objective

This box isn't the destination — it's the doorway.

Use your access here to gather intel and pivot deeper into Infragon’s infrastructure. JenkinsCI is next.

There’s no flag on this system. But what you need *is* here.

## 🧩 Hint

> *“The QA team tests everything — except their own defenses.”*

Look for credentials, scripts, or references to Jenkins pipelines. What QA trusts, attackers exploit.
