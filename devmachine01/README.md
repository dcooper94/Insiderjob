# DevMachine01 — "First Blood"

## 🧠 Background

You're a junior developer at **Infragon Systems**, routinely ignored by your management despite warning them of severe security flaws in the infrastructure. You've spent weeks watching one strange behavior: a mysterious script seems to run every minute... and it's not yours.

You're fed up.

This is where your rebellion begins.

## 🎯 Objective

Gain root access on this machine and retrieve the flag stored in `/root/flag.txt`.

> Flag format: `coops{...}`

## 🧩 Hint

> *“Some scripts are more trusted than they should be. Check what the system’s doing behind your back.”*

## 🧰 Tools Installed

- `nano`, `vim`, `less`
- `git`, `curl`, `wget`
- `python3`, `gcc`, `make`
- `cron`, `lsof`, `net-tools`, `file`

Explore the system. Pay attention to automated behavior. Exploiting trust is your first step.
