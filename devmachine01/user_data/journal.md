# Devuser Journal

- Management ignored me again today. The cron job I flagged last month? Still runs as root. Still executing the same janky script.
- QA team finally set the runner to auto-execute `scripts/build.py` again.
Such a joke â€” zero security. Anyone with write access to Git could wreck that box.
- JenkinsBox is still running that unpatched Python runner. But sure, keep telling me it's not a risk.
- I've got a plan. Just need access. Just one slip-up from them and I'm in.
